### About

A theme engine for Powershell in ConEmu inspired by the work done by Chris Benti on [PS-Config](https://github.com/chrisbenti/PS-Config). And [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) on OSX and Linux (hence the name)
More information about why I made this can be found on my [blog](https://herebedragons.io/shell-shock/).

![Theme](https://herebedragons.io/img/indications.png)

Features:

* Easy installation
* Awesome prompt themes for PowerShell in ConEmu
* Git status indications (powered by posh-git)
* Failed command indication
* Admin indication
* Current session indications (admin, failed command, user)
* Configurable
* Easily create your own theme
* Separate settings for oh-my-posh and posh-git
* Does not mess with the default Powershell console

<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

You should use ConEmu to have a brilliant terminal experience on Windows. You can install it using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) :

```bash
choco install ConEmu
```

The fonts I use are Powerline fonts, there is a great [repository](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) containing them.
I use `Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline Nerd Font` in my ConEmu setup together with custom colors You can find my theme [here](https://gist.github.com/JanJoris/71c9f1361a562f337b855b75d7bbfd28).

```bash

![Theme](http://janjoris.github.com/img/themesettings.png)

You can tweak the settings by manipulating `$ThemeSettings`.
This example allows you to tweak the branch symbol using a unicode character:

````bash
$ThemeSettings.GitSymbols.BranchSymbol = [char]::ConvertFromUtf32(0xE0A0)
````

Also do not forget the Posh-Git settings itself (enable the stash indication for example):

```bash
$GitPromptSettings
```

Creating your own theme
-----------------------

If you want to create a theme it can be done rather easily by adding a `mytheme.psm1` file in the folder indicated in `$ThemeSettings.MyThemesLocation` (the folder defaults to `~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\PoshThemes`, feel free to change it).
The only required function is Write-Theme, you can use the following template to get started:

````bash
#requires -Version 2 -Modules posh-git

function Write-Theme
{
    param(
        [bool]
        $lastCommandFailed,
        [string]
        $with
    )

    # enter your prompt building logic here
}

$sl = $global:ThemeSettings #local settings
````

Feel free to use the public helper functions `Get-VCSStatus`, `Get-VcsInfo`, `Get-Drive`, `Get-ShortPath`, `Set-CursorForRightBlockWrite`, `Save-CursorPosition`, `Pop-CursorPosition`, `Set-CursorUp` or add your own logic completely.
To test the output in ConEmu, just switch to your theme:

```bash
Set-Theme mytheme
```

If you want to include your theme in oh-my-posh, send me a PR and I'll try to give feedback ASAP.

Happy theming!
